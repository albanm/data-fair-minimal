# data-fair-minimal

This is the smallest valid data-fair application. It is meant as a presentation of what an application should do to interact with a data-fair instance.

It is intended for developpers that want to have a precise understanding of what is going on, or those who want to create an application in a framework for which we don't have an example project.

For developpers looking for a modern development framework, [data-fair-slideshow](https://github.com/koumoul-dev/data-fair-slideshow) is a better example.

## Run in a small web server

    npm i -g http-server
    http-server -p 5880 ./src
